# MasterThesis_WhatsWheresHows_of_AI
My first Python project: The analysis of the survey data I collected for my Master Thesis. The survey focused on external data use in the context of Machine Learning
I do not claim that this is the best way to analyze the data and I know that a lot of code can be optimized here
but for having learned Python for only a few months with an online course and using Stack Overflow and Documentations of Libraries while researching for and writing my thesis, 
I think I got pretty far.
I gladly received any feedback for improvements.
Have fun with my code and the data :)
Best wishes
Stuart
